  <h2>Class and Work Projects:</h2>
  <p><strong><em>Airline weather delays.</em></strong> Class project to build an application utilizing big data technologies like Hadoop, Hive, and HBase to understand how to use, scale, and integrate big data technologies under the Lambda architecture.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Getting on Track and Kindergarten Readiness.</em></strong> Support Early Education group at <a href="http://www.norc.org/Pages/default.aspx">NORC</a> by developing features, enhancements, and bug-fixes for a data collection, scoring, and data visualization application. Core tehnologies used for the project are JavaScript (ES5, VueJS), PostgreSQL, and Python (Django, DjangoREST).</p>
  <p><strong><em>Data operations ETLs.</em></strong> Created ETLs in AWS Redshift, SQL, and Python that processes trillions of records for operational reports and ingests various opertional data sources (from PostgreSQL databases and Google Sheets) and writes them into the Braintree data lakes.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Cloud annotator.</em></strong> Cloud computing class project to develop a genomics annotator application using Python and AWS cloud services (Auto scaling, Dyanmo, EC2, S3, Glacier, Route53, ELB) to build a distributed system that handles web-load and data-processing.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Payment processing system.</em></strong> Final project for enterprise integeration and design patterns class; entirely written in Java 8. Used ActiveMQ messaging technology and custom, software-design patterns to transact with login, wallet, and payment subsystems.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Ecommerce application prototype</em></strong> Prototyped an ecommerce solution for Alliance Polymer Solutions. Demonstrated various web-programming concepts using the ruby programming language and Rails 5 framework: bcrypt hashing, authentication, authorization, CRUD operations, site administration, and cart/checkout.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Cloud pricing database.</em></strong> Database class project to store and retreive cloud pricing from a MySQL database. Demonstrates several SQL concepts on the backend: subqueries, join types, views, functions and stored procedures.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Watson natural language API.</em></strong> A project using the Watson natural language API to asynchronously sentiment and context from text and visualize the results with Chart.js. Technologies use for this project are primarily JavaScript: Express, Handlebars, NodeJS.</p>

  <h2>Personal Statement:</h2>
  <p>Dear Dr. Haryadi Gunawi, et al.</p>
  <p>I understand from your original practicum listing and follow-up instructions that commitment is possibly the most important quality that you and research group seek. Having many capable and ambitious computer scientists apply for this practicum position indeed makes it hard to choose which candidate is the right fit. I hope that after reading my statement that you will have no doubt about my interest and commitment to your research.</p>
  <p>Prior to coming to the University of Chicago, I worked in industry as a management consultant for six years helping enterprise clients develop and implement their technology goals and strategies. During my time in industry, I had the opportunity to witness advances in virtualization, networking, cloud, and big data technologies, which have fundamentally changed the way that the world consumes and expects their services to perform at (availability, reliability, and consistency). Being part of these projects inspired me to pursue graduate studies in computer science.</p>
  <p>After commencing graduate studies in Fall 2017, I first saw your practicum posting last year and instantly felt that your group/posting aligned with my interests in computer science and have been purposefully working towards obtaining a research position with you and the UCARE group (taking challenging courses in advanced programming, big data, cloud, design patterns, library development, etc.) --- even arranging coursework so that I only have one class in the winter and spring semesters so I can fully take on the challenge of being in your research group.</p>
  <p>If given the opportunity to work with you and your research group I plan to devote much of my time (&gt;&gt;15 hours) being an active participant with your research group and will gladly spend my summer interning with UCARE.</p>
  <p>Further, if curious about my personal qualities, I have a record of demonstrated discipline, motivation, and success for achieving goals. In consulting I was ranked one of the top-five consultants in a 2000-person organization and was awarded the high honor twice in the firm for excellence in research and delivery. I also have a strong academic record in some of the most challenging courses in the MPCS and have a variety of work experiences on a number of different projects, systems, and languages --- purposefully seeking work and consulting projects that have provided me experience with working with cloud and data-intensive systems.</p>
  <p>In short, I am very excited to finally have the opportunity to apply for this practicum/research position! Thank you very much for your consideration and hope to be in contact with you soon!</p>
  <p>Sincerely, Patrick Huarng</p>
  <p><br></p>
